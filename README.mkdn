Getting Started
---------------

To get started with 7comp, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/initializing.html).

To initialize your local repository using the 7comp trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/Jaiglissechef/manifest.git -b jb4.3

Then to sync up:

    repo sync
